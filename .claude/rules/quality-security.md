# Security Standards

Deep-dive reference for security reviews. See Core Principle 3 ("Keep It Safe") in CLAUDE.md for essentials.

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- [ ] All user input validated + sanitized
- [ ] SQL queries use parameterized statements
- [ ] Auth + authorization properly implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data encrypted at rest + in transit
- [ ] Error messages no expose internal details
- [ ] Dependencies up to date + vuln-free

## OWASP Top 10 2021

| Category | Check For |
|----------|-----------|
| Broken Access Control | Missing authorization checks |
| Cryptographic Failures | Unencrypted sensitive data |
| Injection | SQL, Command, XSS vulnerabilities |
| Insecure Design | Missing threat modeling |
| Security Misconfiguration | Default credentials, debug enabled |
| Vulnerable Components | Outdated/CVE-affected packages |
| Auth Failures | Weak passwords, session issues |
| Integrity Failures | Unsigned updates, untrusted deserialization |
| Logging Failures | Missing audit trails |
| SSRF | Unvalidated URLs in server requests |

## Severity Classification

| Severity | Definition | Action |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Critical | Exploitable vulnerability, data loss risk, high impact | MUST fix before merge |
| High | Exploitable vulnerability, breaking change, moderate impact, major bug | MUST fix before merge |
| Medium | Requires conditions to exploit, performance issue, code smell | SHOULD fix, can negotiate |
| Low | Best practice violation, style, minor improvement | COULD fix, optional |

## CWE References

Reference CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) IDs for standardized vuln classification. Example: `CWE-89` for SQL Injection, `CWE-798` for hardcoded credentials.

## Dependency Safety

- Warn on deprecated/vulnerable deps
- Audit new deps before adding
- Keep deps updated
- Use automated scanning (Trivy, Snyk, Dependabot)

## Output Guidelines

- Never expose actual secrets in analysis output
- Give specific file locations + line numbers
- Include concrete remediation steps
- Check code AND config files
